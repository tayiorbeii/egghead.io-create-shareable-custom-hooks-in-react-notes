Notes and partial transcription of Joe Previte ([@jsjoeio](https://twitter.com/jsjoeio))'s [Create Shareable Custom React Hooks self-paced workshop](https://egghead.io/courses/shareable-custom-hooks-in-react) on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io)

## Description
React 16.8 introduced Hooks like `useState` for using stateful logic in our function components, and `useEffect` for side effects previously only used in class-based components.

The React Team has given developers a way that simplifies using core features, but what's that mean for the code that you write?

In this self-paced workshop, you'll work through refactoring a component to use a custom hook, and learn to apply the patterns used by the React team to your own code.

Follow the React Team's lead, and make your code more readable, reusable, and reasonable!

## Lessons
